# Squid Radio

Squid Radio is a wireless speaker system outfitted with a real-time light display.

The original idea came from a project called Lightshow Pi, which can be found [here](http://www.lightshowpi.org/). This project uses modified versions of the original python scripts to enable compatibility with [BlinkyTile](http://blinkinlabs.com/blinkytile/). A custom UI is also included for dynamically adjusting various audio/display settings.

To use:
1. Install [shairport](https://github.com/abrasive/shairport)
2. Navigate to the ui folder
3. ```npm install```
4. ```npm start```
