#Squid Radio

Squid Radio is a wireless speaker system outfitted with a real-time light display.

The original idea came from a project called Lightshow Pi, which can be found [here](http://www.lightshowpi.com/). The same python scripts were used here, but have been modified to be compatible with [BlinkyTile](http://blinkinlabs.com/blinkytile/). This project also provides a custom UI for dynamically adjusting various audio/display settings.

To use:
1. Install [shairport](https://github.com/abrasive/shairport)
2. Navigate to the ui folder
3. Npm install
4. Npm start
